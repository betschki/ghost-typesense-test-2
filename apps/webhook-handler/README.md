# Ghost Typesense Webhook Handler

A production-ready Netlify Function that keeps your [Typesense](https://typesense.org/) search index synchronized with your [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) blog content in real-time. This webhook handler automatically processes content updates from Ghost and reflects them in your Typesense search index.
